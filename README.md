# Data-Structures
Hello there, welcome to my small tiny cutie github folder where I backup my code and keep track of my progress in Data structures and Algorithms,
in which most of them are self-taught. Those C++ code aren't really that clean to be honest but I tried to shrink them down and make them readable

Usually I like to solve problems that are really interesting and classical (like nQueens and stringPermutations recursive backtracking), 
but I also made some problems up for myself and chalenge my coding skills to move foward (mostly just to keep myself busy since I don't do much at home)

So, I hope you have a nice stay and a nice day, thank you for reading!
